# Babel preset for React HMR and Error Catching

This preset will configure babel for https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr and friends.

At present babel 6 (which is required for presets) isn't supported by babel-plugin-react-transform so you probably want to continue using babel 5.
You can track progress on the upgrade to babel 6 over at [babel-plugin-react-transform PR #50](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform/pull/50)

Once that upgrade is complete, this preset will be a tad bit more useful.
